# Machine Learning Basics 
## Artificial Intelligence vs. Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning 
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML. 
### Artificial Intelligence 
* Branch of Computer Science concerned with building intelligent machines 
* Intelligent machines make decisions on their own (like a Tesla)
### Machine Learning 
* A technique that implements AI to learn from the data by themselves without being explicitly programmed. 
### Deep Learning 
* A subfield of ML that uses Artificial Neural Networks to learn from the data. 
* Artificial Neural Networks --> Mathematical models thare are connected like the neurons in our brain
